    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",

A good way to think about this is that we're **evaluating the right-hand side** of the equals sign and **assigning it to the left-hand side**. Here are some assignment statements:\n",

For example, if we called `farmers_markets_locations.sort(\"x\")`, then running `farmers_markets_locations` by itself would still return the unsorted table.\n",
